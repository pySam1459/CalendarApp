# Calendar application

This is a simple calendar application as a part of my University coursework.<br>
(Not meant to be secure)

## Functionality

The user can creates a calendar with a name and code.<br>
A user can load and delete any calendar given a name and code.<br><br>

A calendar can contain many entries, simply select a date and add an entry.<br>
A start and end time is not neccessary but can be added along with some text.<br>
Enter or press save and your entry will be stored.<br>
